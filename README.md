<h1>Title : Changes to html and css folders for First Homework</h1>

<h3>Objective: To change poor semantic html to proper semantic html and change "dry" css declarations.
</h3>


<p>When the file was first received, there were many issues among them. One being a borken link that would not direct the user to the location on the page when clicked upon. In order to fix this issue we had to change the class selector onto the "search-engine-optimization"to an id(#). The css file was ver "wet". It had a bunch of code that could be used for similar classes. In order to make it neater, combing identical declaration together was idea.</p>

<p>Not only where links not being executed, the format for some of the code wasn't done properly as shown in the image below. Where there was some div tags, a proper semantic tag would be better like a header tag and aside tag. For every image, there was an alt attribute missing which very important to have. It is important to have because incase an image does not load, it will display an image that gives a description of what it would have been.</p>
